#Roblox-Extension-Logger
Intuitive and fast chromium based extension logger written in pure js. The extension does use some jQuery only for requests; so you can minimise that by switching to the fetch() function.

#Publishing an extension
You can learn how to publish an extension here: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/publish/. Edit the manifest.json file if you want to personalize the extension.
